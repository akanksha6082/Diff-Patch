The Way that can be told of is not the eternal way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
akanksha shahs
The Nameless is the origin of the Heaven and Earth;
The Named is the mother of all things.
Therefore let there always be non-being,
	so we may see their subtley,
And let there always be being,
	so we may see their outcome.
The two are the same,
But after they are       produced,
	they have different names.
